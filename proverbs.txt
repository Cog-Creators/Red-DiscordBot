A little knowledge is a dangerous thing
A little of what you fancy does you good
A man who is his own lawyer has a fool for his client
A man with a hammer sees every problem as a nail
A miss is as good as a mile
A new broom sweeps clean, but an old one knows where the dirt is.
A nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse

A person is known by the company he keeps
A picture is worth a thousand words
A place for everything and everything in its place

A man works from sun to sun but a woman's work is never done,
A word to the wise is enough,
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Accidents will happen (in the best-regulated families)
Actions speak louder than words.
Adversity makes strange bedfellows
All good things come to he who waits
All good things must come to an end,
All is grist that comes to the mill
All roads lead to Rome,
All that glitters is not gold,
All the world loves a lover
All things come to those who wait
All things must pass
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,
All you need is love
All is fair in love and war
All is for the best in the best of all possible worlds

An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An army marches on its stomach.
An Englishman's home is his castle
Another day, another dollar.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
Any port in a storm,
Any publicity is good publicity
April showers bring forth May flowers,
As you make your bed, so you must lie upon it
As you sow so shall you reap
Ask a silly question and you will get a silly answer
Ask my companion if I be a thief
Ask no questions and hear no lies
Attack is the best form of defense
Bad news travels fast
Barking dogs seldom bite,
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Beauty is only skin deep,
Beggars should not be choosers,
Behind every great man, there is a great woman
Better late than never
Better safe than sorry
Better the Devil you know than the Devil you do not
Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
Better to light one candle than to curse the darkness
Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt
Better wear out than rust out.

Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has his day
Every Jack has his Jill
Every little bit helps
Every man for himself, and the Devil take the hindmost

Forewarned is forearmed
Fortune favours the brave
Genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains
Give a dog a bad name and hang him

He who loves the world as his body may be entrusted with the empire.
He who makes a beast out of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man
He who pays the piper calls the tune
He who knows does not speak. He who speaks does not know.
He who sups with the Devil should have a long spoon
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Hindsight is always twenty-twenty
History repeats itself
Home is where the heart is
Honesty is the best policy
Hope springs eternal
Horses for courses
Hunger never knows the taste, sleep never knows the comfort
If anything can go wrong, it will
If a job is worth doing, it is worth doing well

If wealth is lost, nothing is lost. If health is lost, something is lost. If character is lost, everything is lost.
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride
If you're growing in Age,then you're nearing to the Graveyard
If you cannot be good, be careful
If you cannot beat them, join them
If you cannot stand the heat, get out of the kitchen

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
In for a penny, in for a pound
In the kingdom of the blind, the one eyed man is king
In the midst of life, we are in death
Into every life a little rain must fall
It goes without saying
It is all grist to the mill
It is an ill wind that blows no one any good
It is best to be on the safe side
It is better to give than to receive
It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
It is better to cultivate a Land with two Bulls, rather working under Boss who never gives Wage when asked
It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness
It is better to travel hopefully than to arrive
It is easy to be wise after the event
It is never too late
It is no use crying over spilt milk
It is no use locking the stable door after the horse has bolted
It is on
It is the early bird that gets the worm
It is the empty can that makes the most noise
It is the squeaky wheel that gets the grease
It never rains but it pours
It takes a thief to catch a thief
It needs a Hundred Lies to cover a Single Lie
It takes all sorts to make a world
It takes one to know one
It takes two to tango
I'm going to have to give you the pink slip
Jack of all trades, master of none
Jack of all trades, master of some

Less is more
Let bygones be bygones
Let not the sun go down on your wrath
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the buyer beware
Let the dead bury the dead
Let the punishment fit the crime
Let well alone
Let your hair down.
Life begins at forty
Life is not all beer and skittles
Life is what you make it
Lightning never strikes twice in the same place
Like father, like son,
Little pitchers have big ears
Little strokes fell great oaks
Little things please little minds
Live and let live
Live for today, for tomorrow never comes
Loose lips, sink ships
Look before you leap
Love is blind
Love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.
Love makes the world go around
Love will find a way
Make hay while the sun shines
Make love not war
Man does not live by bread alone
Manners maketh man
Many a little makes a mickle
Many a mickle makes a muckle
Many a true word is spoken in jest

Money talks
Money makes many things, but also makes devil dance
More haste, less speed

Nature abhors a vacuum,
Never reveal a man's wage, and woman's age

Needs must when the devil drives

Never say never
Never tell tales out of school

No guts, no glory
No man can serve two masters
No man is an island
No names, no pack-drill
No news is good news
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent
No pain, no gain
No rest for the wicked
Nothing is certain but death and taxes
Nothing succeeds like success,
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Once a witch always a witch
Oil and water do not mix
Old soldiers never die; they just fade away
Once a thief, always a thief
Once bitten, twice shy
One good turn deserves another
One half of the world does not know how the other half lives
One hand washes the other
One man's meat is another man's poison
One might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb
One law for the rich and another for the poor
One swallow does not make a summer
One who believes in Sword, dies by the Sword
One year's seeding makes seven years weeding
Only fools and horses work
Opportunity never knocks twice at any man's door
Out of sight, out of mind
Over greedy man, over wrathful woman will never flourish

See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
Seeing is believing
Seek and ye shall find
Set a thief to catch a thief
Shiny are the distant hills
Shrouds have no pockets
Silence is golden
Slow and steady wins the race
Slow but sure
Softly, softly, catchee monkey
Sometimes we are the student.  Sometimes we are the master. And sometimes we are merely the lesson
Spare the rod and spoil the child
Speak as you find
Speak softly and carry a big stick
Speech is silver
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me
Still waters run deep
Strike while the iron is hot
Stupid is as stupid does
Success has many fathers, while failure is an orphan
Take care of the pennies, and the pounds will take care of themselves
Talk is cheap
Talk of the Devil, and he is bound to appear
Tell me who your friends are, and I'll tell you who you are
Tell the truth and shame the Devil
That which does not kill us makes us stronger
The age of miracles is past
The apple never falls far from the tree
The best defence is a good offence
The best-laid schemes of mice and men often go awry
The best things in life are free
The bigger they are, the harder they fall

The bread never falls but on its buttered side
The child is the father of the man
The cobbler always wears the worst shoes
The course of true love never did run smooth
The customer is always right
The darkest hour is just before the dawn
The devil finds work for idle hands
The Devil looks after his own
The early bird catches the worm
The end justifies the means
The exception which proves the rule
The female of the species is more deadly than the male
The good die young
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
The husband is always the last to know
The innocent seldom find an uncomfortable pillow.
The labourer is worthy of his hire
The leopard does not change his spots
The longest day must have an end
The longest journey starts with a single step
The moon is made of green cheese
The more the merrier
The more things change, the more they stay the same
The only way to understand a woman is to love her
The pen is mightier than the sword
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
The shoemaker's son always goes barefoot
The squeaking wheel gets the grease
The straw that broke the camel's back
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach
There ain't no such thing as a free lunch
There are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream
There are none so blind as those that will not see
There are two sides to every question
There but for the grace of God go I
There is an exception to every rule
There are always more fish in the sea
There is honour among thieves
There is many a good tune played on an old fiddle
There is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip
There is more than one way to skin a cat
There is no accounting for tastes
There is no fool like an old fool
There is no place like home
There is no smoke without fire
There is no such thing as a free lunch
There is no such thing as bad publicity

Third time is a charm
Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones
Those who sleep with dogs will rise with fleas
Time and tide wait for no man
Time flies
Time is a great healer
Time is money
Time will tell
’Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
To be worn out is to be renewed.
To each his own.
To err is human, to forgive divine
To the victor go the spoils
To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive
Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow never comes
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Truth is stranger than fiction
Truth will out
Two blacks do not make a white
Two heads are better than one
Two is company, but three is a crowd
Two wrongs do not make a right
Variety is the spice of life.
Walk softly but carry a big stick.
Walnuts and pears you plant for your heirs
Waste not, want not
What cannot be cured must be endured
What goes around, comes around
What goes up must come down
What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts
What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
When it rains it pours.
When the cat is away, the mice will play
When the going gets tough, the tough get going

What the eye does not see, the heart does not grieve over
Where there is a will there is a way
Where there is muck there is brass
Whether you think you can, or you think you can't, you're right.
While there is life there is hope
Whom the Gods love die young
Why keep a dog and bark yourself?
With a responsibility comes great power
Woman is the root of both good and evil
Wonders will never cease
Work expands so as to fill the time available
Worrying never did anyone any good
You ain't seen nothing yet
You are never too old to learn
You are what you eat
You can have too much of a good thing
You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink
You cannot have your cake and eat it too
You cannot get blood out of a stone
You cannot make a silk purse from a sow's ear
You cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs
You cannot make bricks without straw
You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
You cannot teach an old dog new tricks
You cannot judge a book by its cover
You cannot win them all
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
You pay your money and you take your choice
Youth is wasted on the young
You must have rocks in your head
