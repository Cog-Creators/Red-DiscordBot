# Overview

Red is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your
liking, making it completely customizable. This is a *self-hosted bot* – meaning you will need
to host and maintain your own instance. You can turn Red into an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot,
new best friend or all of these together!  

Red is built to be used in [Discord](https://discord.com/), a voice, video, and text chat application that allows users to 
communicate with their friends and communities. Discord utilizes servers that contain chat rooms and 
voice channels that can be accessed through invite links.

[Installation](#installation) is easy, and you do **NOT** need to know anything about coding! Aside
from installing and updating, every part of the bot can be controlled from within Discord.

**The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:**

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
- Trivia (lists are included and can be easily added)
- Music features (YouTube, SoundCloud, local files, playlists, queues)
- Stream alerts (Twitch, Youtube, Picarto)
- Bank (slot machine, user credits)
- Custom commands
- Imgur/gif search
- Admin automation (self-role assignment, cross-server announcements, mod-mail reports)
- Customisable command permissions

**Additionally, other [plugins](#plugins) (cogs) can be easily found and added from our growing
community of cog repositories.**

# Installation

**The following platforms are officially supported:** 

- [Windows](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_guides/windows.html)
- [MacOS](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_guides/mac.html)
- [Most major linux distributions](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_guides/index.html)

If after reading the guide you are still experiencing issues, feel free to join the
[Official Discord Server](https://discord.gg/red) and ask in the **#support** channel for help.

# Plugins

Red is fully modular, allowing you to load and unload plugins of your choice, and install 3rd party
plugins directly from Discord! A few examples are:

- Cleverbot integration (talk to Red and she talks back)
- Ban sync
- Welcome messages
- Casino
- Reaction roles
- Slow Mode
- AniList
- And much, much more!

Feel free to take a [peek](https://index.discord.red) at a list of
available 3rd party cogs!
