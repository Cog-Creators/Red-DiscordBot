msgid "This cog extends the default permission model of the bot. By default, many commands are restricted based on what the command can do.\\nThis cog allows you to refine some of those restrictions. You can allow wider or narrower access to most commands using it. You cannot, however, change the restrictions on owner-only commands.\\n\\nWhen additional rules are set using this cog, those rules will be checked prior to checking for the default restrictions of the command.\\nGlobal rules (set by the owner) are checked first, then rules set for servers. If multiple global or server rules apply to the case, the order they are checked is:\\n  1. Rules about a user.\\n  2. Rules about the voice channel a user is in.\\n  3. Rules about the text channel a command was issued in.\\n  4. Rules about a role the user has (The highest role they have with a rule will be used).\\n  5. Rules about the server a user is in (Global rules only).\\n\\nFor more details, please read the [official documentation](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/cog_permissions.html)."
