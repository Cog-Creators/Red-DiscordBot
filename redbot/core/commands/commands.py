        A decorator that registers a coroutine as a local error handler.

        A local error handler is an :func:`.on_command_error` event limited to
        a single command.

        The on_command_error event is still dispatched
        for commands with a dedicated error handler.

        Red's global error handler will ignore commands with a registered error handler.

        To have red handle specific errors with the default behavior,
        call ``Red.on_command_error`` with ``unhandled_by_cog`` set to True.

        Due to how discord.py wraps exceptions, the exception you are expecting here
        is likely in ``error.original`` despite that the normal event handler for bot
        wide command error handling has no such wrapping.

        For example:

            .. code-block:: python

                @a_command.error
                async def a_command_error_handler(self, ctx, error):

            - ``"discord_deleted_user"``:

                The request should be processed as if
                Discord has asked for the data removal
                This then additionally must treat the
                user ID itself as something to be deleted.
                The user ID is no longer operational data
                as the ID no longer refers to a valid user.

            - ``"owner"``:

                The request was made by the bot owner.
                If removing the data requested by the owner
                would be an operational hazard
                (such as removing a user id from a blocked user list)
                you may elect to inform the user of an alternative way
                to remove that ID to ensure the process can not be abused
                by users to bypass anti-abuse measures,
                but there must remain a way for them to process this request.

            - ``"user_strict"``:

                The request was made by a user,
                the bot settings allow a user to request their own data
                be deleted, and the bot is configured to respect this
                at the cost of functionality.
                Cogs may retain data needed for anti abuse measures
                such as IDs and timestamps of interactions,
                but should not keep EUD such
                as user nicknames if receiving a request of this nature.

            - ``"user"``:

                The request was made by a user,
                the bot settings allow a user to request their own data
                be deleted, and the bot is configured to let cogs keep
                data needed for operation.
                Under this case, you may elect to retain data which is
                essential to the functionality of the cog. This case will
                only happen if the bot owner has opted into keeping
                minimal EUD needed for cog functionality.


        Parameters
        ----------
        requester: Literal["discord_deleted_user", "owner", "user", "user_strict"]
