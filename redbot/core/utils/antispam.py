class AntiSpam:
    """
    A class that can be used to count the number of events that happened
    within specified intervals. Later, it can be checked whether the specified
    maximum count for any of the specified intervals has been exceeded.

    Examples
    --------
    Tracking whether the number of reports sent by a user within a single guild is spammy:

                # More than one report within last 5 seconds is considered spam.

                # More than 3 reports within the last 5 minutes are considered spam.
                (datetime.timedelta(minutes=5), 3),
                # More than 10 reports within the last hour are considered spam.
                (datetime.timedelta(hours=1), 10),
                # More than 24 reports within a single day (last 24 hours) are considered spam.

    Parameters
    ----------
    intervals : List[Tuple[datetime.timedelta, int]]
        A list of tuples in the format (timedelta, int),
        where the timedelta represents the length of the interval,
        and the int represents the maximum number of times something
        can happen within that interval.
