Read before updating
--------------------

#. PM2 process manager is no longer supported as it is not a viable solution due to certain parts of its behavior.

    We highly recommend you to switch to one of the other supported solutions:
        - `autostart_systemd`
        - `autostart_mac`

    If you experience any issues when trying to configure it, you can join `our discord server <https://discord.gg/red>`__ and ask in the **support** channel for help.
#. Information for Audio users that are using an external Lavalink instance (if you don't know what that is, you should skip this point):

    - Red 3.4.10 uses a new Lavalink jar that you will need to manually update from `our GitHub <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Lavalink-Jars/releases/tag/3.3.2.3_1233>`__.
    - We've updated our `application.yml file <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/blob/3.4.10/redbot/cogs/audio/data/application.yml>`__ and you should update your instance's ``application.yml`` appropriately.

Read before updating
--------------------

#. Information for Audio users that are using an external Lavalink instance (if you don't know what that is, you should skip this point):

    Red 3.4.4 uses a new Lavalink jar that you will need to manually update from `our GitHub <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Lavalink-Jars/releases/tag/3.3.2.2_1170>`__.

#. Ubuntu 16.04 is no longer supported as it will soon reach its end of life and it is no longer viable for us to maintain support for it.

    While you might still be able to run Red on it, we will no longer put any resources into supporting it. If you're using Ubuntu 16.04, we highly recommend that you upgrade to the latest LTS version of Ubuntu.

Read before updating
--------------------

#. Red 3.2 dropped support for the MongoDB driver. When updating your instance from an older version, be sure to use instructions for **your current version** from the `document about updating Red <update_red>` to be able to still start your instance after the update.
#. Red 3.2 requires Python 3.8.1 or newer. In order to be able to update, you'll first have to install appropriate versions of your dependencies so be sure to use instructions for **your current version** from the `document about updating Red <update_red>`.

   .. note::

      You may get a notification from the downloader cog about needing to refetch dependencies.
      This is expected and it will walk you through everything and do as much as it can for you.

#. Red 3.2 comes with improvements which required breaking changes for 3rd party cogs. When you update to 3.2, your cogs may not be compatible if the author has not handled
   the changes yet. If you're a cog creator, you can look at `Developer changelog <important-320-1>` for full details.

Developer changelog
-------------------

Breaking Changes
****************

- **Core** - Extension's ``setup()`` function should no longer assume that we are, or even will be connected to Discord (:issue:`3073`)

    This also means that cog creators should no longer use ``bot.wait_until_ready()`` inside it
- **Core - Bank** - Removed ``bank.MAX_BALANCE``, use `redbot.core.bank.get_max_balance()` from now on (:issue:`2926`)
- **Core - Commands Package** - Reserved some command names for internal Red use. These are available programatically as ``redbot.core.commands.RESERVED_COMMAND_NAMES`` (:issue:`2973`)
- **Core - Commands Package** - Qualified command names are limited to a maximum of 60 characters (:issue:`3223`)
- **Core - Bot Class** - The main bot config is no longer directly accessible to cogs. New methods have been added for use where this is concerned (:issue:`2967`)

  New methods for this include:

    - `Red.get_shared_api_tokens()`
    - `Red.set_shared_api_tokens()`
    - `Red.get_embed_colour()` (and its alias - ``get_embed_color()``)
    - `Red.get_admin_roles()`
    - `Red.get_admin_role_ids()`
    - `Red.get_mod_roles()`
    - `Red.get_mod_role_ids()`
- **Core - Bot Class** - Removed ``bot._counter``, Made a few more attributes private (``cog_mgr``, ``main_dir``) (:issue:`2976`)
