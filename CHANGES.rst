The maintainers of the project are not aware of any public 3rd-party cog utilizing this API at the time of writing this changelog. `Full security advisory can be found on our GitHub <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/security/advisories/GHSA-5jq8-q6rj-9gq4>`__.

Redbot 3.5.8 (2024-04-01)
=========================

| Thanks to all these amazing people that contributed to this release:
| :ghuser:`aikaterna`, :ghuser:`Flame442`, :ghuser:`Jackenmen`, :ghuser:`Kreusada`, :ghuser:`TrustyJAID`

Read before updating
--------------------

#. Server-wide mutes in the Mutes cog can no longer be performed using channel permissions (overrides). Instead, the cog will now use Discord's native server timeout functionality when a mute role is not set. Role mutes and channel-specific mutes are not affected.

    Red 3.5.7 and lower allowed usage of channel permissions (overrides) for server-wide mutes when ``[p]muteset forcerole`` setting was explicitly disabled and no mute role was set for the server. This behavior is no longer available and now, when mute role is not set, server-wide mutes will be performed using Discord's native server timeouts.

    If you were one of the few users that chose to use channel permissions (overrides) for server-wide mutes, please note that the existing server mutes will now be considered channel-specific mutes and can only be removed with ``[p]channelunmute`` (and will be automatically removed after timeout elapses, if they have one set). If you want to quickly remove all channel-specific mutes (that were previously server-wide mutes) for a user, you can use the hidden ``[p]forceunmute <user>`` command that has been provided to ease the migration.

#. Information for Audio users that are using an external Lavalink instance (if you don't know what that is, you should skip this point):

    Red 3.5.8 uses a new Lavalink jar that you will need to manually update from `our GitHub <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Lavalink-Jars/releases/tag/3.7.11%2Bred.2>`__.

End-user changelog
------------------

Additions
*********

- **Cogs - Trivia** - Trivia lists can now have a description as documented in :ref:`guide_trivia_list_creation` (:issue:`5897`)

Changes

- **Cogs - Audio** - The cog will now log the reason for Lavalink.jar being re-downloaded (:issue:`6334`)

Redbot 3.5.0 (2023-05-04)
=========================

| Thanks to all these amazing people that contributed to this release:
| :ghuser:`AAA3A-AAA3A`, :ghuser:`aikaterna`, :ghuser:`alexratman`, :ghuser:`AntonioNarra`, :ghuser:`Arman0334`, :ghuser:`Dav-Git`, :ghuser:`Drapersniper`, :ghuser:`Flame442`, :ghuser:`Honkertonken`, :ghuser:`i-am-zaidali`, :ghuser:`Jackenmen`, :ghuser:`japandotorg`, :ghuser:`karlsbjorn`, :ghuser:`keqking`, :ghuser:`Kowlin`, :ghuser:`Kreusada`, :ghuser:`Kuro-Rui`, :ghuser:`leetfin`, :ghuser:`npc203`, :ghuser:`palmtree5`, :ghuser:`PredaaA`, :ghuser:`Predeactor`, :ghuser:`TrustyJAID`, :ghuser:`Vexed01`, :ghuser:`yuansheng1549`

Read before updating
--------------------

#. ``[p]bankset`` is now a core command and as a consequence, the bank cog has been removed. This means that when you start the bot for the first time after the update, you'll see a "Failed to load package bank" message. That is perfectly normal and this message can be ignored.
#. Red 3.5 comes with breaking changes for users. Look at `Backward incompatible changes in Red 3.5 document <incompatible-changes-3.5>` and `End-user changelog <important-350-1>` for full details.

    Note that because this release also comes with breaking changes for developers,
    the cogs you're currently using will likely not work with the new release
    until you update (and that's *if* they have been updated).

    `Our update instructions <update_red>` include instructions on how you can safely update
    your bot and cogs from versions before 3.5. **Make sure** that you look at the instructions
    for **the version you currently have**, not the version you're updating to.

    Note that any cogs that have not yet been updated will likely not work
    until their author releases an update.

#. Red 3.5 comes with breaking changes for cog developers. Look at `Backward incompatible changes in Red 3.5 document <incompatible-changes-3.5>` and `Developer changelog <important-350-2>` for full details.
#. Fedora 35 and Debian 10 (Buster) are no longer supported as they have already reached their end of life.
#. On x86-64 systems, we now require that the CPU supports x86-64-v2 instruction set. This roughly translates to us dropping support for Intel CPUs that have been released before 2009 and AMD CPUs that have been released before 2012.

Read before updating
--------------------

#. Red 3.2 dropped support for the MongoDB driver. When updating your instance from an older version, be sure to use instructions for **your current version** from the `document about updating Red <update_red>` to be able to still start your instance after the update.
#. Red 3.2 requires Python 3.8.1 or newer. In order to be able to update, you'll first have to install appropriate versions of your dependencies so be sure to use instructions for **your current version** from the `document about updating Red <update_red>`.

   .. note::

      You may get a notification from the downloader cog about needing to refetch dependencies.
      This is expected and it will walk you through everything and do as much as it can for you.

#. Red 3.2 comes with improvements which required breaking changes for 3rd party cogs. When you update to 3.2, your cogs may not be compatible if the author has not handled
   the changes yet. If you're a cog creator, you can look at `Developer changelog <important-320-1>` for full details.
