        Features
        --------
        
        -  Parse, read and write any OLE file such as Microsoft Office 97-2003
           legacy document formats (Word .doc, Excel .xls, PowerPoint .ppt,
           Visio .vsd, Project .mpp), Image Composer and FlashPix files, Outlook
           messages, StickyNotes, Zeiss AxioVision ZVI files, Olympus FluoView
           OIB files, etc
        -  List all the streams and storages contained in an OLE file
        -  Open streams as files
        -  Parse and read property streams, containing metadata of the file
        -  Portable, pure Python module, no dependency
        
        olefile can be used as an independent package or with PIL/Pillow.
        
        olefile is mostly meant for developers. If you are looking for tools to
        analyze OLE files or to extract data (especially for security purposes
        such as malware analysis and forensics), then please also check my
        `python-oletools <https://www.decalage.info/python/oletools>`__, which
        are built upon olefile and provide a higher-level interface.
