Self-hosting
------------

You can always self-host on your own hardware.
A Raspberry Pi 3 will be more than sufficient for small to medium sized bots.

For bigger bots, you can build your own server PC for usage, or buy a rack
server. Any modern hardware should work 100% fine.

------------
Free hosting
------------

Google Cloud and AWS both have free tier VPS suitable for small bots.
Additionally, new Google Cloud customers get a $300 credit which is valid
for 12 months.

Other than that... no. There is no good free VPS hoster, outside of
persuading somebody to host for you, which is incredibly unlikely.
