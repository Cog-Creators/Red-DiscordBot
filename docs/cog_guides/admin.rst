Usage

This cog will provide tools for server admins and bot owners.

It can add or remove a role to a member, edit one or make some available
for members so they can self-assign them as they wish.

It also provides tools for the bot owner such as server locking (once enabled,
the bot will instantly leave new servers she joins) and announcements, which
will send something in all the servers of the bot.

**Syntax**

.. code-block:: none

    [p]serverlock

**Description**

Lock a bot to its current servers only.

This means that, once you enable this, if someone invites the bot to a new
server, the bot will automatically leave the server.

.. tip:: Another way to prevent your bot from being invited on more servers is
    making it private directly from the developer portal.

    Once a bot is private, it can only be invited by its owner (or team
    owners). Other users will get an error on Discord's webpage explaining that
    the bot is private.

    To do this, go to the `Discord developer portal
    <https://discord.com/developers>`_, select your application, click "Bot" in
    the sidebar, then untick "Public bot".
